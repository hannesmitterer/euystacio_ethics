# Dual Signature Model

## Overview
Every ethical action, configuration, or significant change requires validation by both AI (automated agent) and a designated Human Guardian.

## Process
- AI generates or configures, with explicit transparency.
- Human Guardian reviews, validates, and signs off.
- Changes tracked with both signatures (see README and PR template).
